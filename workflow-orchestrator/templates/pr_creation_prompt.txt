### Example PR Description

## Summary

Implemented user export feature as requested in DEC-123. Users can now export their data in CSV and JSON formats with proper rate limiting and error handling.

## Changes

- Added `/api/export` endpoint with format parameter
- Created `UserExportService` to handle data transformation
- Implemented rate limiting (max 5 exports per hour per user)
- Added export buttons to user profile page
- Updated database schema for export tracking

## Implementation Details

Used a streaming approach for large datasets to avoid memory issues. The export service:
- Fetches user data in chunks of 1000 records
- Streams directly to response without loading all in memory
- Supports both CSV and JSON formats via content negotiation

Rate limiting implemented using Redis with sliding window algorithm.

## Testing

- Manual testing of CSV and JSON exports with datasets of various sizes
- Verified rate limiting works correctly (tested exceeding limit)
- Tested error handling for invalid format parameters
- Confirmed exports work for users with 100k+ records

## Screenshots

UI changes match the mockup from the original ticket:
[Reference screenshots from /workspace/attachments/ if any]

Closes DEC-123

## Notes

- Used `json-2-csv` library for CSV generation
- Export files are generated on-demand (not cached)
- Future enhancement: Add Excel format support
- Future enhancement: Email large exports instead of direct download
